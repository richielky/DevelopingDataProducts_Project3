Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

Your Shiny Application

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.

Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
It must be 5 pages
It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
NOTE: Slidify is no longer compatible with with Rpubs. If you choose to use Slidify you must share your presentation using GitHub Pages.

Was the presentation completed in slidify or R Presenter?
Was it 5 pages?
Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?
Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?
Was it hosted on github or Rpubs?
Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?
Here's your opportunity to give this presentation a +1 for being well done. Did they tinker around with the default style? Was the presentation particularly lucid and well organized? In other words, the student made a legitimate try.
There were no R errors displayed in the presentation.
